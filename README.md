# Introduction
This file describes the approach and architecture of project 3. In hindsight, the project did not involve that much coding. The main challenge was to find out what kind of training data to feed into the model. Several model architectures were tried out but the differences in outcome were minimal. Therefore, the focus was later on providing better training data. 

# Approach
I am not an experet in CNN and deep learning. Therefore my apporach was to start with things I know and then adapt them to the needs ot the project.
